📈 Deep Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot
This project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) in stock trading, using Stable-Baselines3 to train agents on historical Apple stock data. The goal is to evaluate whether RL-based trading strategies can outperform a simple buy-and-hold approach.

🚀 Project Overview
Reinforcement Learning has achieved remarkable success in Atari games and robotics, but can it be applied to financial markets? This project implements and compares two RL algorithms:

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) – A value-based method that approximates Q-values to make optimal trading decisions.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) – A policy-gradient method that optimizes directly for expected rewards.

⚙️ Implementation Steps
Data Collection – Historical Apple stock price data was used as the training environment.

Custom Trading Environment – Built a Gym-compatible RL environment simulating real-world trading with transaction costs and reward functions.

Model Training – Used Stable-Baselines3 to train DQN and PPO agents.

Evaluation – Compared RL agent performance against a buy-and-hold benchmark using:

Cumulative returns 📈

Sharpe ratio 📊

Maximum drawdown 📉

📝 Key Findings
The RL models learned dynamic trading strategies but did not outperform the simple buy-and-hold strategy in this setup.

Performance varied based on hyperparameter tuning and reward structures.

Reinforcement Learning presents challenges in finance due to noisy data and market unpredictability.
